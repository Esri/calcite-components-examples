# Calcite Components Examples

Working example applications utilizing [calcite-components](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-components). Each folder within this repository is its own mini application demonstrating integration of Calcite Components with other technologies and tooling.

Most frameworks provide a CLI tool to quickly start up a repo. If available, these tools are used to create the examples to ensure they are colloquial to the framework in question. After a starter project is scaffolded up, calcite-components are installed and some general steps are taken:

1. Include Calcite Components' loader and define the custom elements
2. Pull in Calcite Components' global CSS file (provides theming variables, etc)
3. Ensure Calcite Components' assets get copied into the project (allows the `calcite-icon` component to work)

This repository will change over time as new best-practices are established and framework integrations are improved.

## Angular

The [Angular example](./angular/) was built using the `@angular/cli` package:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new [NAME]
```

## Ember

The [ember app](./ember/) used the `ember-cli` package to get started:

```
npm install -g ember-cli
ember new [NAME]
```

## React

The [example react app](./react/) was created using the `create-react-app` utility:

```
npx create-react-app [NAME]
```

There are a few [gotchas for Calcite's React components](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/frameworks/#gotchas), such as Boolean attributes and configuring Jest.

## Preact

The [example preact app](./preact-typescript/) was created using the `preact create` utility:

```
npm install -g preact-cli
preact create typescript [NAME]
```

This example also uses TypeScript, and provides additional instructions for getting calcite components to work inside a TypeScript + Preact environment.

## Vue

The [Vue.js example](./vue/) was built using the `cli-service-global` package:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create [NAME]
```

## Rollup

The [Rollup example](./rollup/) was generated with [rollup-starter-app](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-app):

```
npx degit "rollup/rollup-starter-app" [NAME]
```

## Webpack

The [Webpack example](./webpack/) was built from scratch using Webpack 4.x.
