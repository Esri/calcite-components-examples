# Angular

This examples use [`@esri/calcite-components-angular`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@esri/calcite-components-angular), which provides Angular wrappers for Calcite Components.

## Usage

### Install the packages

Install the Angular components along with [`@esri/calcite-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@esri/calcite-components):

```sh
npm install @esri/calcite-components @esri/calcite-components-angular
```

Make sure the versions of the two packages remain the same when updating your dependencies.

### Copy local assets

Calcite Components rely on assets being available at a particular path. If using assets locally, you'll need to copy these over to your `src` directory. This example has a `copy` npm script, which will automatically run after installing dependencies.

```sh
cp -r node_modules/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets/ ./src/assets/
```

### Import the stylesheet

Import the global stylesheet into your app (only do this once):

```css
/* src/styles.css */
@import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/calcite.css";
```

### Define the custom elements

The Angular wrapper components must use [Calcite Component's Distribution build](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/get-started/#distribution):

```ts
// src/main.ts
import { defineCustomElements } from "@esri/calcite-components/dist/loader";
defineCustomElements(window, { resourcesUrl: "./assets" });
```

### Use the components

Add `CalciteComponentsModule` to the imports of your Angular component's module file:

```ts
// src/app/app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { CalciteComponentsModule } from "@esri/calcite-components-angular";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, CalciteComponentsModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Calcite Components can now be used in your application like any other Angular component!

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<calcite-slider min="1" max="100" [value]="sliderValue" (calciteSliderInput)="onSliderInput($event)"></calcite-slider>
```
